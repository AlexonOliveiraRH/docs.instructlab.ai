### 🔭 Use Cases

TODO

## 📋 Requirements

- **🍎 Apple M1/M2/M3 Mac or 🐧 Linux system** (tested on Fedora).
  We anticipate support for more operating systems in the future.
- C++ compiler
- Python 3.10 or Python 3.11
- Approximately 60GB disk space (entire process)

!!! note
    Python 3.12 is currently not supported, because some dependencies don't work on Python 3.12, yet.

!!! tip
    When installing the `ilab` CLI on macOS, you may have to run the `xcode-select --install` command, installing the required packages previously listed.
