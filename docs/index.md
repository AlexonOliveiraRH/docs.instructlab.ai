## Welcome to InstructLab!

InstructLab 🐶 uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for
Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in Instruct**Lab** 🐶 stands for
[**L**arge-Scale **A**lignment for Chat**B**ots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1].

## 📋 Requirements

- **🍎 Apple M1/M2/M3 Mac or 🐧 Linux system** (tested on Fedora).
  We anticipate support for more operating systems in the future.
- C++ compiler
- Python 3.10 or Python 3.11
- Approximately 60GB disk space (entire process)

> **NOTE:** Python 3.12 is currently not supported, because some dependencies don't work on Python 3.12, yet.
